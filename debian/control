Description: OpenResty-maintained branch of LuaJIT (interpreter)
 LuaJIT implements the full set of language features defined by Lua 5.1. The
 virtual machine (VM) is API- and ABI-compatible to the standard Lua interpreter
 and can be deployed as a drop-in replacement.
 .
 This package contains the standalone interpreter/jitter that can be used
 as a replacement for the standard lua5.1 interpreter.
